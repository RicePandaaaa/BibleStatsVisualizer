# BibleStatsVisualizer

This is a small personal project made to try out some Python stuff while visualizing different aspects of the Bible. The inspiration of this project is this cross reference visualization prject by [Chris Harrison](https://www.chrisharrison.net/index.php/visualizations/BibleViz).

## Data

The data consists of a [JSON file](https://github.com/scrollmapper/bible_databases/tree/master/sources/en/KJV) containing the KJV translation of the Bible from [scrollmapper's bible_databases](https://github.com/scrollmapper/bible_databases) repository. and a plain text file containing cross references for every verse (if applicable) in the Bible by [openbible](https://www.openbible.info/labs/cross-references/). The JSON file download can be found in the link in "JSON file", and the plain text file download can be found at the bottom of the page linked in "openbible".
